  summary: Create a new user session
  description: |-
    Generates a login session for the user based on the credentials provided in the request body or if that fails (due to invalid credentials or none provided at all), generates the new session for the currently authenticated user instead. On a successful session creation, a session cookie is stored to keep the user authenticated for future API calls.

    If CORS is enabled, the origin must match an allowed login origin otherwise an error will be returned.
