get:
  summary: Get a document with the corresponding metadata
  description: |-
    Returns a document's latest revision with its metadata as stored.

    Note: The direct use of this endpoint is unsupported. The sync metadata is maintained internally by Sync Gateway and its structure can change. It should not be used to drive business logic of applications since the response to the `/{db}/_raw/{id}` endpoint can change at any time.

    Required Sync Gateway RBAC roles:

    * Sync Gateway Application
    * Sync Gateway Application Read Only
  parameters:

    - name: salt
      in: query
      description: Whether to apply redaction with a custom salt - the intention here is to allow consistent hashing with a log collection. If this value is not set, a random salt will be used.
