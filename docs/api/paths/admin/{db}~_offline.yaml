  summary: Take the database offline
  description: |-
    This will take the database offline meaning actions can be taken without disrupting current operations ungracefully or having the restart the Sync Gateway instance.

    This will not take the backing Couchbase Server bucket offline.

    Taking a database offline that is in the progress of coming online will take the database offline after it comes online.

    Taking the database offline will:
    * Close all active `_changes` feeds for the database.
    * Reject all access to the database via the Public REST API (returning a 503 Service Unavailable code).
    * Reject most Admin API requests (by returning a 503 Service Unavailable code). The only endpoints to be available are: the resync endpoints, the configuration endpoints, `DELETE, GET, HEAD /{db}/`, `POST /{db}/_offline`, and `POST /{db}/_online`.
    * Stops webhook event handlers.

    Required Sync Gateway RBAC roles:
    * Sync Gateway Architect
