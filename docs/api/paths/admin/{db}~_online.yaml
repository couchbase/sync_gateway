  summary: Bring the database online
  description: |-
    This will bring the database online so the Public and full Admin REST API requests can be served.

    Bringing a database online will:
    * Close the database connection to the backing Couchbase Server bucket.
    * Reload the database configuration, and connect to the backing Couchbase Server bucket.
    * Re-establish access to the database from the Public REST API and accept all Admin API requests.

    A specific delay before bringing the database online may be wanted to:
    * Make the database available for Couchbase Lite clients at a specific time.
    * Make the databases on several Sync Gateway instances available at the same time.

    Required Sync Gateway RBAC roles:
    * Sync Gateway Architect
