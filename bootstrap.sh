#!/bin/sh -e

# This script builds sync gateway using pinned dependencies via the repo tool
#
# It is intended to be run locally via developers (see README for instructions)
# as well as by a CI server.
#
# The basic flow is:
#
# - Detect if repo tool is installed, if not, install it
# - Run 'repo init' to pull Sync Gateway manifest
# - Run 'repo sync' to pull Sync Gateway code and dependencies
# - (optional) for CI server, it can rewrite the manifest for a branch/commit
# - Pull build.sh and test.sh script locally

# rewriteManifest (): Function which rewrites the manifest according commit passed in arguments.
# This is needed by the CI system in order to test feature branches.
#
# Steps
#   - Fetches manifest with given commit
#   - Updates sync gateway pinned commit to match the given commit (of feature branch)
#   - Overwrites .repo/manifest.xml with this new manifest
#
# It should be run *before* 'repo sync'
#
# This technically doesn't need to run on the master branch, and should be a no-op
# in that case.  I have left that in for now since it enables certain testing.
