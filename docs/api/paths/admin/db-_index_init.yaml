  summary: Start asynchronous index initialization
  description: |
    This can be used to start index initialization with different parameters from a running database. The typical workflow is:

    1. Start the process of creating new indexes with [POST /{db}/_index_init](#operation/post_db-_index_init).
    2. Wait for index initialization to complete with [GET /{db}/_index_init](#operation/get_db-_index_init).
    3. Update the database configuration to use these new indexes with [POST /{db}/_config](#operation/post_db-_config).
    4. Call [POST /_post_upgrade](#operation/post__post_upgrade) to remove the original indexes.

    This operation will start creation of indexes, and the creation of indexes can not be stopped on Couchbase Server once it has been started.
