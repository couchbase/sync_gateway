Building From Source (via repo)
-------------------------------

In order to build with [pinned dependencies](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/blob/master/manifest/default.xml), you will need to use the the `repo` multi-repository tool.

**Install prequisites**

```bash
$ brew install repo
```

**Bootstrap initialization -- one time step**

Create a directory where you want to store the Sync Gateway source code and bundled dependencies, and change to that directory.  For example:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/sync_gateway; cd ~/sync_gateway
```

Download the `bootstrap.sh` shell script and run it:

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/master/bootstrap.sh
$ chmod +x bootstrap.sh
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

After it's complete, you should see a message that says `Bootstrap complete!  Run ./build.sh to build and ./test.sh to run tests`

*Note:* if you want to run the bootstrap initialization and start on a particular Sync Gateway commit, you can provide the `-c` flag, eg `./bootstrap.sh -c y0pl33g0r425`.  

**Build and Test**

To build Sync Gateway from source and run the unit tests, run:

```bash
$ ./build.sh && ./test.sh
```

If you run into a `gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found` error, see [issue 1654](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/issues/1654) for help.

**Bootstrap variations: start on a different commit**

To bootstrap and start with a different Sync Gateway commit:

```
$ ./bootstrap.sh -c commit-hash
```

**Switch to a different sync gateway branch via snap-manifest.sh**

Make sure the `repo status` doesn't show any uncommitted changes.  For example in the output below, `docs/BUILD.md` is an uncommitted change:

```bash
$ repo status
project godeps/src/github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/ branch feature/fix_snap_manifest_rebased
 -m     docs/BUILD.md
project godeps/src/github.com/couchbaselabs/sync-gateway-accel/ branch master
project godeps/src/github.com/couchbaselabs/walrus/ branch feature/sg_2418_sgbucket_interface
```

Once the `repo status` is clean, to switch to a different sync gateway commit (which must be pushed up to github):

```bash
$ ./snap-manifest.sh --sg-commit sync-gateway-commit-or-branch
```

**Manually switch to a different sync gateway branch**

You can also switch to a different sync gateway branch manually with these steps.  The commit needs to be on github in this case too:

```bash
$ cd .repo/manifests
$ git reset --hard
$ git fetch
$ git checkout sync-gateway-commit-or-branch
$ vi manifests/default.xml  # edit the sync gateway project commit to have same commit hash as sync-gateway-commit-or-branch
$ cd ../..
$ repo sync -d
```

At this point running `repo status` should return `(working directory clean)`


Build via go get w/ dependency pinning
--------------------------------------

See the [Build Extra](BUILD_EXTRA.md) for instructions on how to build via `go get` (as opposed to `repo`) with dependency pinning.


Cross-compiling for Linux
--------------------------

**x86 Linux**

```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./build.sh
```

**ARM Linux**

```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm ./build.sh
```

The binaries will be saved to `godeps/bin/linux_amd64/` or `godeps/bin/linux_arm/`

Unit Testing options
--------------------


### Environment variables

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SG_TEST_BACKING_STORE  | Walrus by default, but can set to "Couchbase" to have it use http://localhost:8091  |
| SG_TEST_COUCHBASE_SERVER_URL  | Uses http://localhost:8091 by default, but you can set this to any valid Couchbase Server URL  |
| SG_TEST_USE_XATTRS  | Don't use Xattrs by default, but provide the test runner to specify Xattr usage  |
| SG_TEST_USE_AUTH_HANDLER  | Don't use an auth handler by default, but provide a way to override  |


### Running a single unit test against Walrus and Couchbase Server

**Walrus**

```
$ export GOPATH=`pwd`/godeps
$ go test -v -run ^TestChangesAfterChannelAdded$ github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/...
```

**Couchbase Server**

Install Couchbase Server locally and set the Administrator username / password to match the values in `base/constants.go` for `DefaultCouchbaseAdministrator` and `DefaultCouchbasePassword`

```
$ export GOPATH=`pwd`/godeps
$ SG_TEST_BACKING_STORE=Couchbase go test -v -run ^TestChangesAfterChannelAdded$ github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/...
```

### Running full set of unit tests against Couchbase Server

Install Couchbase Server locally and set the Administrator username / password to match the values in `base/constants.go` for `DefaultCouchbaseAdministrator` and `DefaultCouchbasePassword`

```
$ ./test_integration.sh
```
