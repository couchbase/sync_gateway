This will reset your local development environment to the sync gateway commit hash
specified in the argument.

WARNING: make sure all of your commits are pushed up to github before running this!  It may rollback local
git repositories if you snap to a sync gateway version that points to commits earlier than you have locally,
and then you will have to look into the git reflog to try to recover them, which is a pain.  To be safe,
back up your entire sync_gateway directory before running this.

Before running this, you should run:

    $ repo status

and make sure it returns:

    nothing to commit (working directory clean)

Usage:

    $ ./snap-manifest.sh sync-gateway-commit-hash

This will:

1. Download the manifest/default.xml file from the Sync Gateway github repo
2. Modify the manifest to set the Sync Gateway commit passed in
3. Write the modified manifest to ./repo/manifest.xml
4. Run repo sync
