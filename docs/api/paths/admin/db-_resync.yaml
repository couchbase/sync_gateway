  summary: Start or stop Resync
  description: |
    This can be used to start or stop a resync operation. A resync operation will cause all documents in the keyspace to be reprocessed through the sync function.

    Generally, a resync operation might be wanted when the sync function has been modified in such a way that the channel or access mappings for any existing documents would change as a result.

    A resync operation cannot be run if the database is online. The database can be taken offline by calling the `POST /{db}/_offline` endpoint.

    In a multi-node cluster, the resync operation *must* be run on only a single node. Therefore, users should bring other nodes offline before initiating this action. Undefined system behaviour will happen if running resync on more than 1 node.

    The `requireUser()` and `requireRole()` calls in the sync function will always return `true`.

    - **action=start** - This is an asynchronous operation, and will start resync in the background.
    - **action=stop** - This will stop the currently running resync operation.
