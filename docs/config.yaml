          revs_limit:

            description: |
              Maximum depth to which a document's revision tree can grow. The process to remove obsolete revisions is called pruning and runs automatically every time a revision is added. Although fundamentally the same, the pruning algorithm works slightly differently between Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite. On Sync Gateway, the pruning algorithm is applied to the shortest, non-tombstoned branch in the revision tree.
            
              If there are conflicting revisions, the document may end up with **disconnected branches** after the pruning process. In the animation below, the document has a conflicting branch (revisions `4'` - `1001'`). When the shortest branch (in this case the conflicting branch) reaches the 1003rd update, it gets is cut off. The revision tree is not in a corrupted state and the logic that chooses the winning revision still applies. But it may make it impossible to do certain merges (n-way merge) to resolve conflicts and will occupy disk space that could have been free-ed if the conflict was resolved early on.<br><br>
            
              ![](https://cl.ly/3C1G3t3R1v19/pruning-sg.gif)
              
              If the revision tree gets into this state then the only option to resolve the conflict is to pick a winning branch and tombstone all the non-winning conflicting branches. It should be noted that tuning the `revs_limit` to a lower value increases the likelyhood of this scenario happening.
