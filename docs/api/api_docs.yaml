        This is to create a new database for Sync Gateway. 

        The new database name will be the name specified in the URL, not what is specified in the request body database configuration.

        If the bucket is not provided in the database configuration, Sync Gateway will attempt to find and use the database name as the bucket.

        By default, the new database will be brought online immediately. This can be avoided by including `"offline": true` in the configuration in the request body.

        This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.

        Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their `X-Doc-ID` and `X-Rev-ID` headers (if the `attachments` query is `true`).

        A body for a document with no attachments will have content type `application/json` and contain the document itself.

        A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested `multipart/related` body.

      summary: Compare revisions to whats in the database
      description: |-
        This is used by the replicator to detect which revisions Sync Gateway does not have. 

        This takes the document IDs with each having set of revision IDs, then this is used to look up which revisions do not corrospond to what's in the database. An array of the unknown revisions are returned, and an array of known revisions that might be recent ancestors for each of the documents.

        This will upsert a document meaning if it does not exist, then it will be created. Otherwise a new revision will be made for the existing document. A revision ID must be provided if targetting an existing document.

        A document ID must be specified for this endpoint. To let Sync Gateway generate the ID, use the `POST /{db}/` endpoint. 

        If a document does exist, then replace the document content with the request body. This means unspecified fields will be removed in the new revision.

        The maximum size for a document is 20MB.

        Generates a login session for the user based on the credentials provided in the request body or if that fails (due to invalid credentials or none provided at all), generates the new session for the currently authenticated user instead. On a successful session creation, a session cookie is stored to keep the user authenticated for future API calls.

        If CORS is enabled, the origin must match an allowed login origin otherwise an error will be returned.

        This is done through the action query parameter, which has 3 valid values:
        * `start` - starts a stopped replication
        * `stop` - stops an active replication
        * `reset` - resets the replication checkpoint to 0. For bidirectional replication, both push and pull checkpoints are reset to 0. The replication must be stopped to use this.

        This can be used to start or stop a resync operation. A resync operation will cause all documents in the database to be reprocessed through the database sync function. 

        Generally, a resync operation might be wanted when the sync function has been modified in such a way that the channel or access mappings for any existing documents would change as a result.

        **action=start**
        This is an asynchronous operation.

        The `requireUser()` and `requireRole()` calls in the sync function will always return `true`. 

        A resync operation cannot be done if the database is online. The database can be taken offline by calling the `POST /{db}/_offline` endpoint.

        **action=stop**
        This will stop the currently running resync operation.

        The purge command provides a way to remove a document from the bucket itself. The operation removes all the revisions (active and tombstones) for the specified document(s). A common usage of this endpoint is to remove tombstone documents that are no longer needed, thus recovering storage space and reducing data replicated to clients. Other clients are not notified when a revision has been purged; so in order to purge a revision from the system it must be done from all databases (on Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway).

        When convergence is enabled, this endpoint removes the document and its associated extended attributes.

        This will take the database offline meaning actions can be taken without distrupting current operations ungracefully or having the restart the Sync Gateway instance. 

        This will not take the backing Couchbase Server bucket offline. 

        Taking a database offline that is in the progress of coming online will take the database offline after it comes online.

        Taking the database offline will:
        * Close all active `_changes` feeds for the database.
        * Reject all access to the database via the Public REST API (returning a 503 Service Unavailable code).
        * Reject most Admin API requests (by returning a 503 Service Unavailable code). The only endpoints to be available are: the resync endpoints, the configuration endpoints, `DELETE, GET, HEAD /{db}/`, `POST /{db}/_offline`, and `POST /{db}/_online`. 
        * Stops webhook event handlers.

        This allows a new compact operation to be done on the database, or to stop an existing running compact operation. 

        The type of compaction that is done depends on what the `type` query parameter is set to. The 2 options will:
        * `tombstone` - purge the JSON bodies of non-leaf revisions. This is known as database compaction. Database compaction is done periodically automatically by the system. JSON bodies of leaf nodes (conflicting branches) are not removed therefore it is imporant to resolve conflicts in order to re-claim disk space.
        * `attachment` - purge all unlinked/unused legacy (pre 3.0) attachments. If the previous attachment compact operation failed, this will attempt to restart the `compact_id` at the appropiate phase (if possible).

        Both types can each have a maximum of 1 compact operation running at any one point. This means that an attachment compaction can be running at the same time as a tombstone compaction but not 2 tombstone compactions.

            Expiry time after which the document will be purged. The expiration time is set and managed on the Couchbase Server document. The value can be specified in two ways; in ISO-8601 format, for example the 6th of July 2022 at 17:00 in the BST timezone would be `2016-07-06T17:00:00+01:00`; it can also be specified as a numeric Couchbase Server expiry value. Couchbase Server expiries are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of `GET /{db}/{doc} ` when `show_exp=true` is included in the query.

            As with the existing explicit purge mechanism, this applies only to the local database; it has nothing to do with replication. This expiration time is not propagated when the document is replicated. The purge of the document does not cause it to be deleted on any other database.

            How this remote is used depends on the `direction` of the replication:
            * `pull` - this replicator _pulls_ changes from the `remote`
            * `push` - this replicator _pushes_ changes to this `remote`
            * `pushAndPull` - this replicator _pushes_ changes to this `remote`, while also pulling recieving changes

            * `push` - changes are pushed to the remote database
            * `pushAndPull` - changes are both push-to and pulled-from the remote database

            This defines what conflict resolution policy Sync Gateway should use to apply when resolving conflicting revisions.

            Changing this is an enterprise-edition only feature.

            **Behavior**
            * *default* - In priority order, this will cause
              - Deletes to always win (the delete with the logest revision history wins if both revisions are deletes)
              - The revision with the longest revision history to win. This means the the revision with the most changes and therefore the highest revision ID will win.
            * *localWins* - This will result in local revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
            * *remoteWins* - This will result in remote revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
            * *custom* - This will result in conflicts going through your own custom conflict resolver. You must provide this logic as a Javascript function in the `custom_conflict_resolver` parameter. This is an enterprise-edition only feature.


            Note: replications created prior to Sync Gateway 2.8 will default to `default`.
        custom_conflict_resolver:
          type: string
          default: none
          description: "This specifies the Javascript function to use to resolve conflicts between conflicting revisions.\n \nThis **must** be used when `conflict_resolution_type=custom`. This property will be ignored when `conflict_resolution_type` is not `custom`.\n\nThe Javascript function to provide this property should be in backticks (like the sync function). The function takes 1 parameter which is a struct that represents the conflict. This struct has 2 properties:\n* `LocalDocument` - The local document. This contains the document ID under the `_id` key.\n* `RemoteDocument` - The remote document\nThe function should return the new documents body. This can be the winning revision (for example, `return conflict.LocalDocument`), a new body, or `nil` to resolve as a delete.\n\nExample:\n```\n\"custom_conflict_resolver\":\\`\n\tfunction(conflict) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Doc ID: \"+conflict.LocalDocument._id);\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Full remote doc: \"+JSON.stringify(conflict.RemoteDocument));\n\t\treturn conflict.RemoteDocument;\n\t}\n\\`\n```\n\nUsing complex `custom_conflict_resolver` functions can noticeably degrade performance. Use a built-in resolver whenever possible.\n\nThis is an enterprise-edition only feature.\n"

          type: boolean
          default: false
          description: |-
            This will turn on delta- sync for the replication. This works in conjunction with the database level setting `delta_sync.enabled`

            If set to true, delta-sync will be used as long as both databases involved in the replication have delta-sync enabled. If a database does not have delta-sync enabled, then the replication will run without delta-sync.

            Changing this is an enterprise-edition only feature.

            **Behavior**
            * *default* - In priority order, this will cause
              - Deletes to always win (the delete with the logest revision history wins if both revisions are deletes)
              - The revision with the longest revision history to win. This means the the revision with the most changes and therefore the highest revision ID will win.
            * *localWins* - This will result in local revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
            * *remoteWins* - This will result in remote revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
            * *custom* - This will result in conflicts going through your own custom conflict resolver. You must provide this logic as a Javascript function in the `custom_conflict_resolver` parameter. This is an enterprise-edition only feature.


            Note: replications created prior to Sync Gateway 2.8 will default to `default`.

This property will be ignored when `conflict_resolution_type` is not `custom`.\n\nThe Javascript function to provide this property should be in backticks (like the sync function). The function takes 1 parameter which is a struct that represents the conflict. This struct has 2 properties:\n* `LocalDocument` - The local document. This contains the document ID under the `_id` key.\n* `RemoteDocument` - The remote document\nThe function should return the new documents body. This can be the winning revision (for example, `return conflict.LocalDocument`), a new body, or `nil` to resolve as a delete.\n\nExample:\n```\n\"custom_conflict_resolver\":\\`\n\tfunction(conflict) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Doc ID: \"+conflict.LocalDocument._id);\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Full remote doc: \"+JSON.stringify(conflict.RemoteDocument));\n\t\treturn conflict.RemoteDocument;\n\t}\n\\`\n```\n\nUsing complex `custom_conflict_resolver` functions can noticeably degrade performance. Use a built-in resolver whenever possible.\n\nThis is an enterprise-edition only feature.\n"

            If set, always serve attachments with the `Content-Type` header set to the type of the attachment.

            When serving an attachment, usually the `Content-Type` header is set to the type of the attachment but the `Content-Disposition` response header will be set instead if the content type is vulnerable to a phishing attack, causing the browser to download the file instead of display it. This option will override that behaviour and always set the `Content-Type` header.
