        This will allow multiple documented to be created, updated or deleted in bulk.

        To create a new document, simply add the body in an object under `docs`. A doc ID will be generated by Sync Gateway unless `_id` is specified.

        To update an existing document, provide the document ID (`_id`) and revision ID (`_rev`) as well as the new body values.

        To delete an existing document, provide the document ID (`_id`), revision ID (`_rev`), and set the deletion flag (`_deleted`) to true.

        This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.

        Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their `X-Doc-ID` and `X-Rev-ID` headers (if the `attachments` query is `true`).

        A body for a document with no attachments will have content type `application/json` and contain the document itself.

        A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested `multipart/related` body.

      summary: Get changes list
      description: |-
        This request retrieves a sorted list of changes made to documents in the database, in time order of application. Each document appears at most once, ordered by its most recent change, regardless of how many times it’s been changed.

        This request can be used to listen for update and modifications to the database for post processing or synchronization. A continuously connected changes feed is a reasonable approach for generating a real-time log for most applications.

        This will upsert a document meaning if it does not exist, then it will be created. Otherwise a new revision will be made for the existing document. A revision ID must be provided if targetting an existing document.

        A document ID must be specified for this endpoint. To let Sync Gateway generate the ID, use the `POST /{db}/` endpoint. 

        If a document does exist, then replace the document content with the request body. This means unspecified fields will be removed in the new revision.

        The maximum size for a document is 20MB.

      description: |-
        This request retrieves a file attachment associated with the document. 

        The raw data of the associated attachment is returned (just as if you were accessing a static file). The `Content-Type` response header is the same content type set when the document attachment was added to the database. The `Content-Disposition` response header will be set instead if the content type is vulnerable to a phishing attack, causing the browser to download the file instead of display it (unless overriden by by database config option `serve_insecure_attachment_types`).

        If the `meta` query parameter is set then the response will be in JSON with the additional metadata tags.

        This request adds or updates an attachment associated with the document. If the document does not exist, it will be created and the attachment will be added to it.

        The maximum content size of an attachment is 20MB. The `Content-Type` header of the request should be what the content type of the attachment is otherwise this will default to `application/octet-stream`.

        If the attachment already exists, the data of the existing attachment will be replaced in the new revision. The revisions are for tracking document changes, not attachment changes.

        To remove an attachment from a document, simply update the `_attachments` dictionary of the document in the `PUT /{db}/{docid}` request.

      description: |-
        This returns the Dot syntax of the revision tree for the document so that it can be rendered in to a PNG image using the [Graphviz CLI tool](http://www.graphviz.org/).

        To use:
        1. Install the Graphviz tool. Using Brew, this can be done by calling `brew install graphviz`.
        2. Save the response text from this endpoint to a file (for example, `revtree.dot`).
        3. Render the PNG by calling `dot -Tpng revtree.dot > revtree.png`.

        The purge command provides a way to remove a document from the bucket itself. The operation removes all the revisions (active and tombstones) for the specified document(s). A common usage of this endpoint is to remove tombstone documents that are no longer needed, thus recovering storage space and reducing data replicated to clients. Other clients are not notified when a revision has been purged; so in order to purge a revision from the system it must be done from all databases (on Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway).

        When convergence is enabled, this endpoint removes the document and its associated extended attributes.

          description: |-
            Expiry time after which the document will be purged. The expiration time is set and managed on the Couchbase Server document. The value can be specified in two ways; in ISO-8601 format, for example the 6th of July 2022 at 17:00 in the BST timezone would be `2016-07-06T17:00:00+01:00`; it can also be specified as a numeric Couchbase Server expiry value. Couchbase Server expiries are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of `GET /{db}/{doc} ` when `show_exp=true` is included in the query.

            As with the existing explicit purge mechanism, this applies only to the local database; it has nothing to do with replication. This expiration time is not propagated when the document is replicated. The purge of the document does not cause it to be deleted on any other database.
