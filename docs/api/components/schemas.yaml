        Expiry time after which the document will be purged. The expiration time is set and managed on the Couchbase Server document. The value can be specified in two ways; in ISO-8601 format, for example the 6th of July 2022 at 17:00 in the BST timezone would be `2016-07-06T17:00:00+01:00`; it can also be specified as a numeric Couchbase Server expiry value. Couchbase Server expiry values are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of `GET /{db}/{doc} ` when `show_exp=true` is included in the query.

        As with the existing explicit purge mechanism, this applies only to the local database; it has nothing to do with replication. This expiration time is not propagated when the document is replicated. The purge of the document does not cause it to be deleted on any other database.

      x-enumDescriptions:
        default: |-
          This will use:
            - Timestamp based conflict resolution (often referred to as "last write wins", or LWW). Which uses a document timestamp from most recent document revisions to compare.
            - The revision with the most recent timestamp wins.
            - If replicating a document that was last updated/written pre upgrade to SG 4.x, the default policy for versions < 4.x will be used.
        localWins: This will result in local revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
        remoteWins: This will result in remote revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
        custom: This will result in conflicts going through your own custom conflict resolver. You must provide this logic as a Javascript function in the `custom_conflict_resolver` parameter.
    continuous:
      description: |-
        If true, changes will be immediately synced when they happen. This is known as a continuous replication.

        If false, all changes will be synced until they have been processed. The replication will then cease and not process any future changes (unless started again by the user). This is known as a one-shot replication.
      type: boolean
      default: false
    custom_conflict_resolver:
      description: |-
        This specifies the Javascript function to use to resolve conflicts between conflicting revisions.

        This **must** be used when `conflict_resolution_type=custom`. This property will be ignored when `conflict_resolution_type` is not `custom`.

        The Javascript function to provide this property should be in backticks (like the sync function). The function takes 1 parameter which is a struct that represents the conflict. This struct has 2 properties:
          * `LocalDocument` - The local document. This contains the document ID under the `_id` key.
          * `RemoteDocument` - The remote document
        The function should return the new document's body. This can be the winning revision (for example, `return conflict.LocalDocument`), a new body, or `nil` to resolve as a delete.

        Example:

        ```javascript
        function(conflict) {
          console.log("Doc ID: "+conflict.LocalDocument._id);
          console.log("Full remote doc: "+JSON.stringify(conflict.RemoteDocument));
          return conflict.RemoteDocument;
        }
        ```

        Using complex `custom_conflict_resolver` functions can noticeably degrade performance. Use a built-in resolver whenever possible.

        If a document merge is being done, the `_rev` and `_cv` properties should not be included in the returned document body as Sync Gateway will generate new values for these.

        This is an Enterprise Edition only feature.

        Specifies the maximum time-period (in minutes) that Sync Gateway will attempt to reconnect to a lost or unreachable remote.

        When a disconnection happens, Sync Gateway will do an exponential backoff up to this specified value. When this value is met, it will attempt to reconnect indefinitely every `max_backoff_time` minutes.

        If this is set to 0, Sync Gateway will do the normal exponential backoff after the disconnect happens but then attempting 10 minutes and stop the replication.

        Each partition is processed by an independent function that runs simultaneously to others, so `import_partitions` can be used to tune concurrency based on the number of Sync Gateway nodes, and the number of cores per node.

            Couchbase Server connection string/URL for bootstrap configuration.
            The connection string should only reference Couchbase Server Data (KV) nodes.
            Using other node types (Query, Index, Analytics, or Search nodes) is not supported.
            **Connection String Format**
            Sync Gateway supports the ability to resolve DNS SRV records for alternate hostnames, or specifying multiple hostnames explicitly. See the [Couchbase Go SDK documentation on DNS SRV records](https://docs.couchbase.com/go-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#using-dns-srv-records) for more details.
            Sync Gateway supports both the couchbases:// for TLS and couchbase:// schemes for insecure connection.
            The supported schemes match that of the Couchbase Server SDKs.
            **Examples of valid server values:**
            - `couchbases://nodeA.example.com`
            - `couchbase://nodeA.example.com`
            - `couchbases://nodeA.example.com,nodeB.example.com`
            - `couchbase://nodeA.example.com,nodeB.example.com`
            - `couchbases://nodeA.example.com:1234,nodeB.example.com:1234`
            - `couchbase://nodeA.example.com:1234,nodeB.example.com:1234`
            - `couchbases://127.0.0.1`
            - `couchbase://127.0.0.1`
            On startup, Sync Gateway will try all hostnames until it is able
            to connect successfully.
            **Port Information**
            When using the couchbase:// or couchbases:// schemes, the port is not required as Sync Gateway will use the default Couchbase Server client-to-node ports (11210 for couchbase:// and 11207 for couchbases://). See the [Couchbase Server ports documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/install-ports.html#ports-listed-by-communication-path) for more details.
            **Alternate Addresses**
            If your Couchbase Server cluster is running in a containerized, port mapped, or otherwise NATd environment like Docker or Kubernetes, Sync Gateway might need more information to connect to the cluster. In many cases the client is able to automatically select the correct set of addresses.
            If the detection heuristic fails in your environment, it is possible to override this behavior by adding a network parameter to the connection string.
            The network parameter can be:
            - `external`: Force the use alternate addresses of Couchbase Server. Used when Sync Gateway should not share network used by Couchbase Server internally.
            - `default`: Do not allow use of alternate addresses of Couchbase Server. Used when Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server are on the same network.
            Example: `"server": "couchbases://my-cbs-server?network=default"`
            Will force the connection to ignore any alternative external addresses configured
            on the Couchbase Server node.
            **Lost Connections**
            If the connection to Couchbase Server is lost during normal operations, Sync Gateway
            will automatically re-connect to another node in the cluster.

It is not recommended to set this unless you require additional horizontal scalability for individual indexes and have appropriately scaled your Query nodes to handle the increased query parallelism. If set, the recommended number is 8 and does not need to be directly related to the number of your Query nodes. Ensure documentation is read to understand the performance tradeoffs and instructions for migration if you have previously run with only one partition. See [/{db}/_index_init](#operation/post_db-_index_init) for more information.

    If not specified or 1, all indexes will be non partitioned.
