  summary: Get multiple documents in a MIME multipart response
  description: |
    This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.

    Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their `X-Doc-ID` and `X-Rev-ID` headers (if the `attachments` query is `true`).

    A body for a document with no attachments will have content type `application/json` and contain the document itself.

    A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested `multipart/related` body.
  parameters:
    - name: attachments
      in: query
      description: This is for whether to include attachments in each of the documents returned or not.
      schema:
        type: boolean
        default: 'false'
    - $ref: ../../components/parameters.yaml#/include-revs
    - name: revs_limit
      in: query
      description: The number of revisions to include in the response from the document history. This parameter only makes a different if the `revs` query parameter is set to `true`. The full revision history will be returned if `revs` is set but this is not.
      schema:
        type: integer
    - name: X-Accept-Part-Encoding
      in: header
      description: If this header includes `gzip` then the part HTTP compression encoding will be done.
      schema:
        type: string
    - name: Accept-Encoding
      in: header
      description: If this header includes `gzip` then the the HTTP response will be compressed. This takes priority over `X-Accept-Part-Encoding`. Only part compression will be done if `X-Accept-Part-Encoding=gzip` and the `User-Agent` is below 1.2 due to clients not being able to handle full compression.
