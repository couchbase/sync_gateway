  summary: Set runtime configuration
  description: |-
    This endpoint is used to dynamically set runtime options, like logging without needing a restart.

    These options are not persisted, and will not survive a restart of Sync Gateway.

    The endpoint only accepts a limited number of options that can be changed at runtime. See request body schema for allowable options.
