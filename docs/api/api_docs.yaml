        This is to create a new database for Sync Gateway. 

        The new database name will be the name specified in the URL, not what is specified in the request body database configuration.

        If the bucket is not provided in the database configuration, Sync Gateway will attempt to find and use the database name as the bucket.

        By default, the new database will be brought online immediately. This can be avoided by including `"offline": true` in the configuration in the request body.

        This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.

        Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their `X-Doc-ID` and `X-Rev-ID` headers (if the `attachments` query is `true`).

        A body for a document with no attachments will have content type `application/json` and contain the document itself.

        A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested `multipart/related` body.

        This will upsert a document meaning if it does not exist, then it will be created. Otherwise a new revision will be made for the existing document. A revision ID must be provided if targetting an existing document.

        A document ID must be specified for this endpoint. To let Sync Gateway generate the ID, use the `POST /{db}/` endpoint. 

        If a document does exist, then replace the document content with the request body. This means unspecified fields will be removed in the new revision.

        The maximum size for a document is 20MB.

        # Admin API
        Generates a login session for a user and returns the session ID and cookie name for that session. If no TTL is provided, then the default of 24 hours will be used.

        A session cannot be generated for an non-existent user or the `GUEST` user.

        # Public API
        Generates a login session for the user based on the credentials provided in the request body or if that fails (due to invalid credentials or none provided at all), generates the new session for the currently authenticated user instead. On a successful session creation, a session cookie is stored to keep the user authenticated for future API calls.

        If CORS is enabled, the origin must match an allowed login origin otherwise an error will be returned.

        To use:
        1. Install the Graphviz tool. Using Brew, this can be done by calling `brew install graphviz`.
        2. Save the response text from this endpoint to a file (for example, `revtree.dot`).

        This can be used to start or stop a resync operation. A resync operation will cause all documents in the database to be reprocessed through the database sync function. 

        Generally, a resync operation might be wanted when the sync function has been modified in such a way that the channel or access mappings for any existing documents would change as a result.

        **action=start**
        This is an asynchronous operation.

        The `requireUser()` and `requireRole()` calls in the sync function will always return `true`. 

        A resync operation cannot be done if the database is online. The database can be taken offline by calling the `POST /{db}/_offline` endpoint.

        **action=stop**
        This will stop the currently running resync operation.

        The purge command provides a way to remove a document from the bucket itself. The operation removes all the revisions (active and tombstones) for the specified document(s). A common usage of this endpoint is to remove tombstone documents that are no longer needed, thus recovering storage space and reducing data replicated to clients. Other clients are not notified when a revision has been purged; so in order to purge a revision from the system it must be done from all databases (on Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway).

        When convergence is enabled, this endpoint removes the document and its associated extended attributes.

      summary: Take the database offline
      description: |
        This will take the database offline meaning actions can be taken without distrupting current operations ungracefully or having the restart the Sync Gateway instance. 

        This will not take the backing Couchbase Server bucket offline. 

        Taking a database offline that is in the progress of coming online will take the database offline after it comes online.

        Taking the database offline will:
        * Close all active `_changes` feeds for the database.
        * Reject all access to the database via the Public REST API (returning a 503 Service Unavailable code).
        * Reject most Admin API requests (by returning a 503 Service Unavailable code). The only endpoints to be available are: the resync endpoints, the configuration endpoints, `DELETE, GET, HEAD /{db}/`, `POST /{db}/_offline`, and `POST /{db}/_online`. 
        * Stops webhook event handlers.

      summary: Manage a compact operation
      description: |-
        This allows a new compact operation to be done on the database, or to stop an existing running compact operation. 

        The type of compaction that is done depends on what the `type` query parameter is set to. The 2 options will:
        * `tombstone` - purge the JSON bodies of non-leaf revisions. This is known as database compaction. Database compaction is done periodically automatically by the system. JSON bodies of leaf nodes (conflicting branches) are not removed therefore it is imporant to resolve conflicts in order to re-claim disk space.
        * `attachment` - purge all unlinked/unused legacy (pre 3.0) attachments. If the previous attachment compact operation failed, this will attempt to restart the `compact_id` at the appropiate phase (if possible).

        Both types can each have a maximum of 1 compact operation running at any one point. This means that an attachment compaction can be running at the same time as a tombstone compaction but not 2 tombstone compactions.

            Expiry time after which the document will be purged. The expiration time is set and managed on the Couchbase Server document. The value can be specified in two ways; in ISO-8601 format, for example the 6th of July 2022 at 17:00 in the BST timezone would be `2016-07-06T17:00:00+01:00`; it can also be specified as a numeric Couchbase Server expiry value. Couchbase Server expiries are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of `GET /{db}/{doc} ` when `show_exp=true` is included in the query.

            As with the existing explicit purge mechanism, this applies only to the local database; it has nothing to do with replication. This expiration time is not propagated when the document is replicated. The purge of the document does not cause it to be deleted on any other database.

            When a disconnection happens, Sync Gateway will do an exponential backoff up to this specified value. When this value is met, it will attempt to reconnect indefnitely every `max_backoff_time` minutes.

            If this is set to 0, Sync Gateway will do the normal exponential backoff after the disconnect happens but then attempting 10 minutes and stop the replication.

            This is a set of key/value pairs used in the query string of the replication.

            If `filters=sync_gateway/bychannel` then this can be used to set the channels to filter by in a pull replication. To do this, set the `channels` key to a string array of the channels to filter by. For example:
            ```
            "filter":"sync_gateway/bychannel",
            "query_params": {
