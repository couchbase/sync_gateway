== Overview

This folder contains the following tools:

. `sgcollect_info` -- a tool that collects diagnostics from Sync Gateway, such as logs, heap profile, cpu profile, expvars, etc.
. A copy of `cbcollect_info` and `tasks.py`, which was refactored from the upstream `cbcollect_info` in the https://github.com/couchbase/ns_server/blob/master/cbcollect_info[ns_server repository], which has since diverged from this version.  `sgcollect_info` depends on the `cbcollect_info` in this repo.


== SG Collect Info

=== Install dependencies (optional)

To improve the quality of the collected zip files, install the following dependencies:

- Go -- ideally use the version of Go that was used to build Sync Gateway
- Graphviz

When you see errors in the `sgcollect_info` output, it will give hints about other tools that need to be installed.

|Filename |Description

|sync_gateway.log

=== How to render raw heap files locally

If `go` and/or `graphviz` is not installed on the machine where `sgcollect_info` is run, you can still render the raw profiles into a text or pdf formats with:

. Modify `pprof_http_heap.log` to remove the top four header lines to avoid the error `pprof_http_heap.log: parsing profile: unrecognized profile format`.  For example: `sed -e '1,4d' pprof_http_heap.log > pprof_http_heap_noheader.log`
. Pass the path to the **actual Sync Gateway binary** that was collected in the sgcollect_info zipfile.  Eg: `go tool pprof -top /path/to/sync_gateway modified_pprof_http_heap.log`
