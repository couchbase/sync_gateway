  summary: Create a new Sync Gateway database
  description: |-
    This is to create a new database for Sync Gateway.

    The new database name will be the name specified in the URL, not what is specified in the request body database configuration.

    If the bucket is not provided in the database configuration, Sync Gateway will attempt to find and use the database name as the bucket.

    By default, the new database will be brought online immediately. This can be avoided by including `"offline": true` in the configuration in the request body.
