  summary: Get an attachment from a document
  description: |-
    This request retrieves a file attachment associated with the document.

    The raw data of the associated attachment is returned (just as if you were accessing a static file). The `Content-Type` response header is the same content type set when the document attachment was added to the database. The `Content-Disposition` response header will be set if the content type is considered unsafe to display in a browser (unless overridden by by database config option `serve_insecure_attachment_types`) which will force the attachment to be downloaded.

    If the `meta` query parameter is set then the response will be in JSON with the additional metadata tags.

  summary: Create or update an attachment on a document
  description: |-
    This request adds or updates an attachment associated with the document. If the document does not exist, it will be created and the attachment will be added to it.

    If the attachment already exists, the data of the existing attachment will be replaced in the new revision.

    The maximum content size of an attachment is 20MB. The `Content-Type` header of the request specifies the content type of the attachment.

    To remove an attachment from a document, omit the attachment in the `_attachments` object of the document in the `PUT /{db}/{docid}` request.
