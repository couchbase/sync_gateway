  summary: Get multiple documents in a MIME multipart response
  description: |
    This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.

    Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their `X-Doc-ID` and `X-Rev-ID` headers (if the `attachments` query is `true`).

    A body for a document with no attachments will have content type `application/json` and contain the document itself.

    A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested `multipart/related` body.

    Required Sync Gateway RBAC roles:
    * Sync Gateway Application
    * Sync Gateway Application Read Only
  parameters:
  - name: attachments
    in: query
    description: This is for whether to include attachments in each of the documents
      returned or not.
    schema:
      type: boolean
      default: "false"
  - $ref: ../../components/parameters.yaml#/include-revs
  - name: revs_limit
    in: query
    description: The number of revisions to include in the response from the document
      history. This parameter only makes a different if the `revs` query parameter
      is set to `true`. The full revision history will be returned if `revs` is set
      but this is not.
    schema:
      type: integer
  - name: X-Accept-Part-Encoding
    in: header
    description: If this header includes `gzip` then the part HTTP compression encoding
      will be done.
    schema:
      type: string
  - name: Accept-Encoding
    in: header
    description: If this header includes `gzip` then the the HTTP response will be
      compressed. This takes priority over `X-Accept-Part-Encoding`. Only part compression
      will be done if `X-Accept-Part-Encoding=gzip` and the `User-Agent` is below
      1.2 due to clients not being able to handle full compression.
