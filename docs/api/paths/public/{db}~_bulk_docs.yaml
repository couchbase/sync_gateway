  summary: Bulk document operations
  description: |-
    This will allow multiple documented to be created, updated or deleted in bulk.

    To create a new document, simply add the body in an object under `docs`. A doc ID will be generated by Sync Gateway unless `_id` is specified.

    To update an existing document, provide the document ID (`_id`) and revision ID (`_rev`) as well as the new body values.

    To delete an existing document, provide the document ID (`_id`), revision ID (`_rev`), and set the deletion flag (`_deleted`) to true.
