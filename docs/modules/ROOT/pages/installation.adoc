Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Ubuntu |CentOS/RedHat |Debian |Windows |macOS
|12, 14 |5, 6, 7 |8 |Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012
|Yosemite, El Capitan
|=======================================================================

Network configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sync Gateway uses specific ports for communication with the outside
world, mostly Couchbase Lite databases replicating to and from Sync
Gateway. The following table lists the ports used for different types of
Sync Gateway network communication:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Port |Description
|4984 |Public port. External HTTP port used for replication with
Couchbase Lite databases and other applications accessing the REST API
on the Internet.

|4985 |Admin port. Internal HTTP port for unrestricted access to the
database and to run administrative tasks.
|=======================================================================

Once you have downloaded Sync Gateway on the distribution of your choice
you are ready to install and start it as a service.

Walrus mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Sync Gateway uses a built-in, in-memory server called
"Walrus" that can withstand most prototyping use cases, extending
support to at most one or two users. In a staging or production
environment, you must connect each Sync Gateway instance to a Couchbase
Server cluster.

Connecting to Couchbase Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect Sync Gateway to Couchbase Server:

* https://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads[Download] and
install Couchbase Server.
* Open the Couchbase Server Admin Console on http://localhost:8091 and
log on using your administrator credentials.
* In the toolbar, select the *Data Buckets* tab and click the *Create
New Data Bucket* button. image:../img/cb-create-bucket.png[image]
* Provide a bucket name, for example *mobile_bucket*, and leave the
other options to their defaults.
* Specify the bucket name and Couchbase Server host name in the Sync
Gateway configuration.

        }
    }
}
....

Couchbase Server network configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a typical mobile deployment on premise or in the cloud (AWS, RedHat
etc), the following ports must be opened on the host for Couchbase
Server to operate correctly: 8091, 8092, 8093, 8094, 11207, 11210,
11211, 18091, 18092, 18093. You must verify that any firewall
configuration allows communication on the specified ports. If this is
not done, the Couchbase Server node can experience difficulty joining a
cluster. You can refer to the
link:/documentation/server/current/install/install-ports.html[Couchbase
Server Network Configuration] guide to see the full list of available
ports and their associated services.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing Sync Gateway, you should have completed the Getting
Started instructions for Couchbase Lite on the platform of
link:../index.html[your choice] (iOS, Android, .NET, Xamarin, Java or
PhoneGap). To begin synchronizing between Couchbase Lite and Sync
Gateway follow the steps below:

1.  Create a new file called *sync-gateway-config.json* with the
following configuration.
+
....
{
    "databases": {
        "hello": {
            "server": "walrus:",
            "users": {"GUEST": {"disabled": false, "admin_channels": ["*"]}},
            "sync": `function (doc, oldDoc) {
                if (doc.sdk) {
                    channel(doc.sdk);
                }
            }`
        }
    }
}
....
+
This configuration file creates a database called `hello` and routes
documents to different channels based on the document's `sdk` property,
if it exists.
2.  Start Sync Gateway from the command line.
+
....
~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway ~/path/to/sync-gateway-config.json
....
3.  Run the application where Couchbase Lite is installed. You should
then see the documents that were replicated on the admin UI at
http://localhost:4985/_admin/.
