  summary: Purge a document
  description: |-
    The purge command provides a way to remove a document from the database. The operation removes *all* revisions (active and tombstones) for the specified document(s). A common usage of this endpoint is to remove tombstone documents that are no longer needed, thus recovering storage space and reducing data replicated to clients. Other clients are not notified when a revision has been purged; so in order to purge a revision from the system it must be done from all databases (on Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway).

    When `enable_shared_bucket_access` is enabled, this endpoint removes the document and its associated extended attributes.
