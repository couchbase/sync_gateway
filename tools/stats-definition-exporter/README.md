# Sync Gateway Prometheus Stat Definition Exporter
This tool exports all the Prometheus Sync Gateway stats definitions to a JSON file. The JSON is prettified by using tab indents and new lines.

## Output
### To File
By default, this tool will output to a file. named `metrics_metadata.json`. This is outputted in the current working directory.

Use the `-output` flag to change the output location and name.

### To Stdout
To output to stdout only and not to a fail, use the `-no-file` flag. The `-output` flag will be ignored when this is `true`.

## Logging
The tool may output to stderr when unexpected problems occur. For example, this maybe due to a stat not being initialized or a stat being nil.

## JSON format
The JSON is an array of objects in the current format:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "string",
    "unit": "string",
    "labels": ["strings"],
    "help": "string",
    "format": "string",
    "type": "string"
  }
]
```

- `name` is the fully qualified name of the stat.
- `unit` is what unit the stat uses such as bytes or nanoseconds. If the stat has no units, then this will be omitted.
- `labels` is a list of label keys that Prometheus uses to uniquely distinguish between the same stat being declared multiple times. For example, `databases`, `collections` etc. This is omitted if the stat has no labels.
- `help` contains a description of what the stat does.
- `format` is the format of the value the stat stores such as int, float, duration, etc.
- `type` is how Prometheus shows the stat such as it being a such as counter, gauge, etc.
