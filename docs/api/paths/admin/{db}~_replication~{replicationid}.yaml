  summary: Upsert a replication
  description: |-
    Create or update a replication in the database.

    The replication ID does **not** need to be set in the request body.

    If an existing replication is being updated, that replication must be stopped first and, if the `replication_id` is specified in the request body, it must match the replication ID in the URI.
