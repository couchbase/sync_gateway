    data. If no custom sync function is provided in the request body, the
    default or user-defined sync function for the collection is used.

    | Yes      | Yes   | The document passed in the body will be newDoc and DocID will be read from the bucket/collection and will be passed as the oldDoc. If DocID doesn't exist, then oldDoc will be empty |
    | No       | No    | Will throw an error                                                                                                                                                                  |
