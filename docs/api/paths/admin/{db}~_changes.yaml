  summary: Get changes list
  description: |-
    This request retrieves a sorted list of changes made to documents in the database, in time order of application. Each document appears at most once, ordered by its most recent change, regardless of how many times it has been changed.

    This request can be used to listen for update and modifications to the database for post processing or synchronization. A continuously connected changes feed is a reasonable approach for generating a real-time log for most applications.

      of a prior response.

      - _doc_ids
  - name: channels
    in: query
    description: A comma-separated list of channel names to filter the response to
      only the channels specified. To use this option, the `filter` query option must
      be set to `sync_gateway/bychannels`.
    schema:
      type: string
  - name: doc_ids
    in: query
    description: A valid JSON array of document IDs to filter the documents in the
      response to only the documents specified. To use this option, the `filter` query
      option must be set to `_doc_ids` and the `feed` parameter must be `normal`.

    description: The interval (in milliseconds) to send an empty line (CRLF) in the
      response. This is to help prevent gateways from deciding the socket is idle
      and therefore closing it. This is only applicable to `feed=longpoll` or `feed=continuous`.
      This will override any timeouts to keep the feed alive indefinitely. Setting
      to 0 results in no heartbeat. The maximum heartbeat can be set in the server
      replication configuration.

      before the response is sent, even if there are no results. This is only applicable
      for `feed=longpoll` or `feed=continuous` changes feeds. Setting to 0 results
      in no timeout.
