  summary: Control a replication state
  description: |-
    Control the replication by changing its state.

    This is done through the action query parameter, which has 3 valid values:
    * `start` - starts a stopped replication
    * `stop` - stops an active replication
    * `reset` - resets the replication checkpoint to 0. For bidirectional replication, both push and pull checkpoints are reset to 0. The replication must be stopped to use this.
